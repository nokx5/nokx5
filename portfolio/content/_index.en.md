Hi ! ðŸ‘‹

<img src="raccoon.jpg" alt="https://www.novaextermination.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/exterminateur-raton-laveur.jpg" style="zoom:67%;" />

I am a software engineer with a background in quantum mechanics and in
AI optimization (tensorflow/pytorch). I am currently moving from
Switzerland :switzerland: to Australia :australia: due to the hospital
:hospital: exchange program of my partner.

This website is a portfolio about my interests, software experiences
and activities. Enjoy! :thumbs_up:
