SUPER LIEN : 

I had the great opportunity to work with a [very talented physicist](https://www.lumni.fr/video/le-verre-par-thierry-giamarchi-physicien). I am very gratefull to [Pr. Thierry Giamarchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Giamarchi) for giving me the opportunity to work by his side on quantum materials. During my research time at the [Department of Quantum Matter](https://dqmp.unige.ch/giamarchi/) of [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/en), I focused on the physics of strongly correlated quantum antiferromagnets with `meV` energy scales coupling. 

### Abstract of my PhD

We investigate thermal effects of strongly correlated low-dimensional
spin systems. Their behavior could be studied in different phases by
the use of large external magnetic fields on real compounds. The
description of the materials requires focus on the correlation
functions of the effective quantum models.



We used the best numerical tools to date to study dynamical
correlations in low-dimensional systems at finite temperature and end
with a greater insight into magnetic materials. We used the Density
Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to study the different microscopic
models and compared with Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS)
experiments on various compounds performed by different groups.  Those
two different independent methods (experience and theory) make the
physics so exciting.



We study both numerical and analytical quasi-one-dimensional spin
systems which offer rich physics and show deviations to expected
analytical behavior such as the low temperature bosonization
prediction or Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid theory (TLL).



## Scientific codes

During my PhD time, I had the opportunity to clean and reinstall the research group's cluster and to run intensive scientific simulations on it. I felt very much concerned about reproducibility of codes in science.
