I had the great opportunity to work with a [very talented physicist](https://www.lumni.fr/video/le-verre-par-thierry-giamarchi-physicien). I am very gratefull to [Pr. Thierry Giamarchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Giamarchi) for giving me the opportunity to work by his side on quantum materials. During my research time at the [Department of Quantum Matter](https://dqmp.unige.ch/giamarchi/) of [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/en), I focused on the physics of strongly correlated quantum antiferromagnets with `meV` energy scales coupling. 

Luckily, I had the opportunity to clean and reinstall the research group's cluster and to run intensive scientific algorithm on it. 



### Resume

During my PhD, 

After my research time, I felt concerned about reproducility of results in the academy. 



Nevertheless, here is a list of articles and books I enjoyed a lot during my time there.
