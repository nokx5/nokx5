description: "About nokx software"

I like to program because I like to organize data, in particular when it comes to details. My philosophy is  "make it works, then optimize". I like working with computers because of the rules they provide (like in a game). Algorithms and design patterns are beautiful, so don't mess them. I like working in team on complex pipelines.

I use on-going projects symbols below : :cloud:=considered, :car:=started, :hammer:=â€‹WIP, :star:=stabilized

The important things with coding is to have some on-going projects. However it is generally difficult to code on multiple projects at the same time. :smiley_cat: 

I'm currently fascinated by [nix :snowflake:](https://nixos.org/)  and consider it as a possible solution for code reproducibility in science. I like creating Docker images or AppImage directly from nix, this concept of one language to rule them all is very promising. I'm now concerned about moving to cloud services such as AWS or Azure and becoming a CloudOps.
