I started as a young boy playing percussions, then focused on jazz drums :drum: and later on vibraphone :musical_keyboard: as well. I was very lucky to work with a very talented drummer and percussionist  at the [popular music conservatory](https://conservatoirepopulaire.ch/). I will list here some methods we used during my progression with him.

# Band

The practice of live music and development of the hear couldn't have been possible without other musician. I am particularly grateful to two teachers of the *Atelier Junior* at [AMR](https://www.amr-geneve.ch/) for letting me practice two different instruments with other young motivated musician. During the covid crisis, I missed the jam sessions and the live instruments a lot.

Finally, I met Dehlia, my partner, in this jazz environment. I replaced someone on the drums for a live concert and she was playing the double bass. :heart:

Jazz is broad and alive!
